## Soul Grinds

### 1. Soul
**Description:** A soul grind is seemingly an easy grind, however it requires extra coordination of your body to be able to hold on to. As with any regular soul grind, your dominant (back) foot will be locked on the soul plate, and your front foot will be moved forward towards the direction you're grinding in, extending the reach of your leg. You will lock your front foot on the groove of the frame.
